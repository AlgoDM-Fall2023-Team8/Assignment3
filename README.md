# Visual Search and Style Transfer Showcase
This repository hosts a collection of interactive Streamlit applications that demonstrate the power of visual search and style transfer in the field of computer vision. These applications are designed to showcase various techniques and models that allow users to explore and search for images based on both visual similarity and artistic style.

# Overview
The project consists of three distinct parts, each of which serves as a self-contained Streamlit application:

# Part 1: Image Search By an Artistic Style
In the "Image Search By an Artistic Style" application, users can embark on a journey through the world of art by uploading their own images and applying the styles of famous artists. This interactive experience enables users to search for images with similar artistic styles and experiment with neural style transfer techniques. With a curated dataset of 32 unique artistic styles, users can appreciate the beauty of different art movements and their impact on images.

# Part 2: Visual Search by Similarity
The "Visual Search" application takes users on a visual exploration of clothing items. Leveraging a comprehensive Clothing Dataset, users can search for visually similar clothing items and even find clothing with matching attributes, such as category, gender, or age group. This application showcases the power of visual search models for retrieving clothing items based on both visual appearance and context.

# Part 3: Visual Search by VAE
In "Visual Search Using Variational Autoencoders," the project demonstrates the capabilities of unsupervised feature learning with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By training a VAE on the Fashion MNIST dataset, users can witness how VAEs learn a smooth and regular manifold in the feature space, enabling efficient visual search. This prototype application provides an opportunity to navigate the learned embedding space and perform visual searches for fashion items.

# Project Outcomes
By exploring these interactive Streamlit applications, users can gain a deeper understanding of visual search, style transfer, and unsupervised feature learning. The applications provide hands-on experiences that allow users to appreciate the beauty of art, discover clothing items, and perform efficient visual searches.

These applications are not only valuable educational resources but also serve as showcases for the potential applications of computer vision in various domains, from art and fashion to visual search and recommendation systems.
